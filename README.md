I’m a software developer currently working on crypto-related systems, building software that interacts with blockchain technology and embraces complexity.

I code because I enjoy it — exploring how things work, breaking them apart, and putting them back together in better ways.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually traveling abroad, experiencing new cultures, and finding inspiration in different places.
